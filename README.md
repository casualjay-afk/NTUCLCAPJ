About this Project

Video Games Sales data has been provided by Sequoia Capital a venture capital firm interested into investing into a Video Game Start up company in 2024. They have tasked us J & E Analytics to further breakdown and understand the data. Data has been provided during the physical video game sales era, before digitalization and the transition from selling physical copies to digital copies of Video Games.

Sequoia Capital would like to break into this industry and has tasked us to understand data collected from multiple sources to understand which genre and Location they should branch out from. We have been tasked to analyse the changes in sales in the video game industry within its respective regions and as a whole.
